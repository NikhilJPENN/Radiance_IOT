IOT Device for Non Contact Temperature Measurement and Thermal Image Mapping


https://devpost.com/software/radiance-v673dy


Our device provides clients with the ability to remotely access data from Radiance's on-board thermographic camera and thermopile sensors to enforce quality control standards of temperature-sensitive goods such as perishables or heat-sensitive chemicals during processing or manufacturing. It enables clients to monitor and perform operations effectively on assembly and manufacturing lines. It provides the visual sight on location where human inspection or visual camera monitoring are difficult.

Radiance's sensors are mounted on a 180-degree swivel platform powered by a remotely controlled servo motor, allowing the client to get temperature readings with a 235-degree field of view. All the logged data is easy accessible to clients via our cloud dashboard.

Clients can also update Radiance's firmware to take advantage of the latest features using the Over The Air Firmware Update capabilities accessible through our cloud application interface/dashboard. Increasing automation improves the quality of the entire value chain. The person can use information to program and control operations and make decisions to optimize the quality, safety, efficiency and environmental aspects of production.
